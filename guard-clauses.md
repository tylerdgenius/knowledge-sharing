## üõ°Ô∏è Guard Clauses: Write Cleaner, Safer, and More Readable Code

As our codebases grow, so does complexity ‚Äî and with it, the temptation to nest logic in multiple layers of `if` statements. One of the most effective and underrated tools for writing **clean, readable, and bug-resistant code** is the **guard clause**.

This article covers:

* What guard clauses are
* Why they improve code
* When to use them
* Real-world examples

### üö® What Is a Guard Clause?

A **guard clause** is a conditional check that exits a function early when a certain condition is met ‚Äî usually to handle edge cases or invalid inputs. This helps avoid deeply nested blocks and keeps the main logic focused and readable.

**Example (without guard clause):**

```ts
function processUser(user?: User) {
  if (user) {
    if (user.isActive) {
      // Main logic here
    } else {
      throw new Error("User is not active");
    }
  } else {
    throw new Error("User not found");
  }
}
```

**With guard clauses:**

```ts
function processUser(user?: User) {
  if (!user) throw new Error("User not found");
  if (!user.isActive) throw new Error("User is not active");

  // Main logic here
}
```

Notice how the second version is flatter and easier to scan.

### ‚úÖ Why Use Guard Clauses?

1. **Improved Readability**: Your core logic isn't buried under nested conditions.
2. **Early Exit for Invalid State**: Makes it obvious what conditions stop execution.
3. **Reduces Cognitive Load**: Easier to follow the main flow of the function.
4. **Minimizes Bugs**: Cleaner separation of error handling and primary logic.

### üß† When Should You Use Them?

Use guard clauses when:

* You want to fail fast on invalid inputs or edge cases.
* There are multiple exit conditions.
* Nesting `if` statements makes the function harder to follow.
* You want your main logic to be front and center.

Don't overdo them: if your function becomes a list of 10 guard clauses, that could indicate it needs to be split into smaller functions.

### üß™ Real-World Example

Let's say we want to update a user's email:

```ts
async function updateUserEmail(userId: string, newEmail: string) {
  const user = await userRepo.findById(userId);

  if (!user) throw new Error("User not found");
  if (!newEmail.includes("@")) throw new Error("Invalid email format");
  if (!user.isVerified) throw new Error("User is not verified");

  user.email = newEmail;
  await userRepo.save(user);
  return user;
}
```

This is flat, readable, and fails fast. Each guard clause ensures the function only continues if conditions are met.

### üßπ Bonus: Combine with Type Narrowing

Guard clauses can also help with **type narrowing** in TypeScript:

```ts
function handle(input: string | number) {
  if (typeof input === 'number') {
    return input * 2;
  }

  // input is guaranteed to be string here
  return input.toUpperCase();
}
```

### üîö Final Thoughts

Guard clauses are a small shift in mindset that lead to **more maintainable and reliable code**. By checking edge cases early and exiting fast, we keep our main logic clean, focused, and free of unnecessary indentation.

**Guard your logic. Protect your sanity.**
